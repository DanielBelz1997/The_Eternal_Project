Certainly! Let's walk through an example implementation of query caching using materialized views and adjusting PostgreSQL configuration parameters. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Enable Materialized Views for Query Caching:

Create a materialized view that stores the results of a complex query. This view will be periodically refreshed to update the cached data.
sql
Copy code
-- Create the materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW cached_data AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table
WHERE condition;

-- Refresh the materialized view periodically (e.g., every hour)
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW cached_data WITH DATA;
In this example, the cached_data materialized view stores the results of a query on the table based on a specific condition. You can schedule the refresh operation using cron jobs or other scheduling mechanisms based on your requirements.

Adjust PostgreSQL Configuration Parameters:

Modify the PostgreSQL configuration file (postgresql.conf) to adjust important parameters that impact query performance.
plaintext
Copy code
# postgresql.conf

shared_buffers = 4GB        # Adjust based on available memory
work_mem = 64MB             # Adjust based on query complexity and available memory
effective_cache_size = 8GB  # Adjust based on available memory and database size
In this example, we've adjusted the shared_buffers, work_mem, and effective_cache_size parameters. The values you choose may vary based on your specific hardware, workload, and available system resources. It's important to monitor and fine-tune these parameters based on performance testing and evaluation.

Utilize the Materialized View in Queries:

Modify your application queries to utilize the materialized view for query caching.
sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM cached_data
WHERE condition;
In your application code, replace the original complex query with a simple query that retrieves data from the cached_data materialized view. This will fetch the cached results, providing a faster response time compared to executing the complex query directly against the underlying table.

By combining materialized views for query caching and adjusting PostgreSQL configuration parameters, you can significantly improve query performance in scenarios where repetitive queries are executed against large datasets. However, keep in mind that this is just one approach, and the suitability of query caching and configuration adjustments may vary depending on your specific application requirements.

Remember to thoroughly test and monitor the performance impact of these optimizations in your specific environment. Additionally, consult the PostgreSQL documentation and seek expert advice to fine-tune the configuration parameters and caching strategy for your particular use case.

Fix two: send your request to a proxy
You can’t ask your users to trick their browsers by installing a plugin that applies an header in the frontend. But you can control the backend address that the web app’s API requests are going to.

The cors-anywhere server is a proxy that adds CORS headers to a request. A proxy acts as an intermediary between a client and server. In this case, the cors-anywhere proxy server operates in between the frontend web app making the request, and the server that responds with data. Similar to the Allow-control-allow-origin plugin, it adds the more open Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * header to the response.

It works like this. Say your frontend is trying to make a GET request to:

https://joke-api-strict-cors.appspot.com/jokes/random

But this api does not have a Access-Control-Allow-Origin value in place that permits the web application domain to access it. So instead, send your GET request to:

https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://joke-api-strict-cors.appspot.com/jokes/random

The proxy server receives the https://joke-api-strict-cors.appspot.com/jokes/random from the url above. Then it makes the request to get that server’s response. And finally, the proxy applies the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * to that original response.

This solution is great because it works in both development and production. In summary, you’re taking advantage of the fact that the same origin policy is only implemented in browser-to-server communication. Which means it doesn’t have to be enforced in server-to-server communication!

The one downside of the cors-anywhere proxy is that can often take a while to receive a response. The latency is high enough to make your applications appear a bit sluggish.

Practical example
Let’s say we have a React application with an Express backend. Our frontend is running on port 3000 - a common default for React.

Since our backend cannot also run on port 3000 locally, we’ll setup Express to run on port 4000.

const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 4000

app.get('/whoami', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Who is anybody?')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
If our React application made a fetch request to our backend like this:

// Fetch request made from http://127.0.0.1:3000
fetch("http://127.0.0.1:4000/whoami")
we should expect a CORS error. Just like our earlier example, 127.0.0.1:3000 and 127.0.0.1:4000 are treated as two separate domains, so you cannot make requests across them yet. Let’s look at a few ways to fix this.

Fix 1: Fixing the server
One approach is to fix our server. We can do this by installing a CORS library (https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) and telling the server to expect requests from 127.0.0.1:3000

app.use(cors({
    origin: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
}))
Our requests will now succeed. This approach is pretty straightforward and is generally good practice. We can use this same approach in production in case our frontend and backend are hosted on two different subdomains.

Fix 2: Adding a proxy
In production, in some cases, you’ll host your frontend and backend from the same origin. In these cases, you usually want to write fetch code that looks like this:

fetch("/whoami")
instead of like this:

const url;
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    url = "https://www.example.com/whoami"
} else {
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:4000/whoami"
}
fetch(url)
To do this, create-react-app actually comes natively with the ability to set up a simple proxy. Add the following to your package.json:

"proxy": "http://localhost:4000",
Then, any request that looks like an API request (e.g. has a content type application/json) will automatically get forwarded to http://localhost:4000.

The reason this bypasses CORS issues is because, to the browser, the request is going to http://localhost:3000 and therefore doesn’t look like a cross-origin request. The server at http://localhost:3000 does forward the request to http://localhost:4000, but the browser doesn’t know that.

‍

If you are using Next.js instead of create-react-app, you can set up a redirect in your next.config.js which will forward all matching traffic:

module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/api/:path*',
        destination: 'http://localhost:4000/:path*'
      }
    ]
  }
}
Summary
The simplest way to fix any CORS issues in React and Next.js is actually not to change anything in React or Next.js but instead to fix your server to allow requests from them.

If you cannot change the server, both React and Next.js have ways for you to turn them into proxies and proxy requests to your backend on your behalf. This avoids any CORS issues by making your browser think the request is not a cross-origin request anymore.
