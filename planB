Sure, let's create a sample row in a hypothetical PostgreSQL table with the structure you've described. We'll then run the query to filter rows based on the "place" value being "Value1".

Assuming we have a table named "sample_table" with a "feat" column:

plaintext
Copy code
| id | feat                                                      |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | [{subobject1: {"place": "Value1"}, subobject2: {...}},   |
|    |  {subobject1: {"place": "Value2"}, subobject2: {...}},...] |
Now, let's run the query to filter rows where the "place" value is "Value1":

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM sample_table
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM jsonb_array_elements(sample_table.feat) AS subobject
    WHERE subobject->'subobject1'->>'place' = 'Value1'
);
Assuming the query returns rows, they would be displayed in the standard PostgreSQL row format, including all columns for each matching row. If you have specific data you'd like to see or if you'd like to see the results for a specific scenario, please let me know!

i think you didnt understand. i want to get only one row anyway. but i want theat one row will present in that spesific column only the data i wanted.

I apologize for any confusion. Let's create a sample row and then demonstrate how to retrieve only specific data from that row based on your criteria.

Let's say we have a table called "data_table" with the following structure:

plaintext
Copy code
| id | feat                                                        |
|----|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | [{"subobject1": {"place": "Value1"}, "subobject2": {...}}, |
|    |  {"subobject1": {"place": "Value2"}, "subobject2": {...}}]  |
We want to retrieve only the data from the "feat" column that has "place" equal to "Value1". Here's the query to achieve this:

sql
Copy code
SELECT ARRAY_REMOVE(
    ARRAY(
        SELECT jsonb_set(
            jsonb_set(subobject, '{subobject2}', '{}'::jsonb),
            '{subobject1}',
            ('{"place": "Value1"}'::jsonb),
            true
        )
        FROM jsonb_array_elements(data_table.feat) AS subobject
        WHERE subobject->'subobject1'->>'place' = 'Value1'
    ),
    NULL
) AS feat_with_value1
FROM data_table
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM jsonb_array_elements(data_table.feat) AS subobject
    WHERE subobject->'subobject1'->>'place' = 'Value1'
);
In this query:

We use a subquery to filter the array elements where "place" is "Value1" and modify them accordingly.
We use jsonb_set to update the subobject with the desired "place" value of "Value1".
ARRAY_REMOVE is used to remove any NULL values that might have been introduced during the update.
The result of this query will be a single row with a modified "feat" column that only contains the subobject where "place" is "Value1".
